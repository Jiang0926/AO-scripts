AO-scripts
==========

In this repo, Matlab scripts for adaptive optics (AO) are published.

Most of the scripts are directly related to SHWFS (Shack-Hartmann Wavefront Sensors).
In the 'slopes-visualization' is e.g. a script published which reconstructs the wavefront
based on zonal reconstruction and visualize it side by side with the slope data.
